I am using VS code as an IDE.

I installed 3 C++ compilers for my Windows OS machine and have confirmed they all work: 
- gcc
- clang
- MSVC (microsoft's compiler for C++)

I have configured my IDE to create a C++ template project (see .vscode folder),
which allows me in my IDE to complile a C++ program using any of the 3 compilers
(see capture.jpg)

As confirmation I am attaching a picture of my IDE setup with the options to 
choose which compiler to use, and I am taking a picture of terminal output
when running the compiled program.
