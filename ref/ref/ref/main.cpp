	// C++ is STATICALLY TYPE SAFE.
	// The types are all checked during compilation.
	// can't do thing slike java or python and have objects type change over the course of the program
	// this is really great but adds to the friciton of programming

	// to reduce this friction C++ uses inference.
	// C++ can often infer the type without your needing to mention it
	// Giving you the benefits of static type safety without the headaches.
	// --> e.g. "auto" keyword, and TEMPLATES
